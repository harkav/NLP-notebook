Asked chatgpt for some ideas for what I can do with this right now. 

# 🧠 NLP Project Ideas with TF-IDF & Similarity Measures

You've already implemented TF-IDF, cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, and dot product — that's a solid foundation. Here's a list of pedagogical project ideas you can build with what you have:

---

## 1. 🔍 Document Similarity Search Engine

Build a simple search engine where a user inputs a query and gets back the most similar document from a small corpus.

- Use **TF-IDF** for vectorization
- Use **cosine similarity** or **Euclidean distance** for ranking

💡 *Great for showing how search engines work under the hood.*

---

## 2. 🕵️ Plagiarism Detection Tool

Compare each pair of documents in a corpus to detect similarities.

- Use **cosine similarity** to measure document overlap
- Flag pairs with similarity above a certain threshold

💡 *Demonstrates how semantic similarity can detect content reuse.*

---

## 3. ⚖️ TF-IDF vs Raw Frequency Comparison

Compute document similarities using:
- Raw term frequency vectors
- TF-IDF vectors

Compare the two results.

💡 *Illustrates why TF-IDF works better by emphasizing informative terms.*

---

## 4. 🏷 Keyword Extraction with TF-IDF

Rank words in a document by their TF-IDF score and extract the top `k` as "keywords".

💡 *Shows how important words can be automatically identified.*

---

## 5. 🗂 Document Clustering (Manual or Simple k-means)

Group similar documents based on cosine similarity:
- Visual inspection
- Or simple clustering algorithm like k-means (optional extension)

💡 *Lets students explore how unsupervised grouping can reveal topic structure.*

---

## 6. 🗺 Semantic Map with Dimensionality Reduction

1. Compute pairwise cosine similarity matrix  
2. Apply **PCA** or **t-SNE** to reduce TF-IDF vectors to 2D  
3. Plot documents in 2D space

💡 *Visualizes which documents are close or distant semantically.*

---

## 7. 😃 Naive Sentiment Classification via Similarity

Use pre-labeled "positive" and "negative" documents:
- Compare a new document to each group
- Assign sentiment based on which group it's most similar to

💡 *Introduces the concept of prototype-based classification.*
