Poisoned apples all round.
As always, whenever there's a negative hype around a movie, my mindset is always, prove them wrong, give it a chance.

It's diabolical, honestly, I can't understand how so much money and so much time has gone into this, the final result is cringe worthy. It is an absolute shocker, I am stumped to find any positives.

It looks and feels so artificial, the sets, the animals, as for The Dwarves themselves, I have no words to express my feelings there.

The biggest catastrophe, not what I was expecting if I'm honest, the worst offender, Gal Gadot, she looks sensational, but her performance, she's going to scoop some unwanted awards it's fair to say.

What I wasn't expecting, was just how poor the costumes would look on screen, Snow White's just doesn't translate very well, the hairstyle, what were they thinking?

Disney, what on Earth have you done?
