# Mini-Project Ideas: Lexical Semantics & Word Vectors

ideas generated by chatgpt

## 1. Synonym Detection with Word Embeddings
- **Goal:** Use pretrained word vectors (e.g., GloVe or Word2Vec) to find synonyms for given words.
- **Steps:**
  - Load pretrained embeddings.
  - Pick a small list of target words.
  - Find the closest vectors (cosine similarity) and output the top 5 synonyms.
- **Bonus:** Evaluate against a small hand-curated synonym list or WordNet.

## 2. Visualizing Semantic Relationships
- **Goal:** Train word2vec on a small domain-specific corpus (e.g., a few Greek philosophical texts or any text of your choice).
- **Steps:**
  - Preprocess text, train word2vec.
  - Use t-SNE or PCA to reduce embeddings to 2D.
  - Plot and visually explore clusters of semantically related words.
- **Bonus:** Explore analogies like “king” - “man” + “woman” ≈ “queen”.

## 3. Semantic Change Detection
- **Goal:** Compare word embeddings trained on two different time-period corpora and find words whose meanings changed.
- **Steps:**
  - Pick two small corpora representing two “time slices” (e.g., old vs. modern text).
  - Train separate word2vec models.
  - Measure vector shifts for select words.
  - Report words with largest semantic change.
- **Bonus:** Try to explain why a particular word changed meaning.

## 4. Word Similarity Evaluation
- **Goal:** Evaluate how well word embeddings capture semantic similarity.
- **Steps:**
  - Use a small benchmark dataset of word pairs with human similarity scores (like SimLex-999 subset).
  - Calculate cosine similarity for those pairs using embeddings.
  - Compute correlation with human judgments.
- **Bonus:** Compare different embeddings (GloVe vs. Word2Vec vs. FastText).

## 5. Contextual Word Similarity
- **Goal:** Explore how context changes word meaning with a simple embedding model.
- **Steps:**
  - Extract sentences containing a target word.
  - Train a small embedding per context (e.g., average word vectors of sentence).
  - Visualize or cluster contexts to show polysemy or different senses.
- **Bonus:** Try with ambiguous words like “bank” or “light”.
