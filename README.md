# NLP-notebook

In this project, I hope to demonstrate several algorithms used in Natural language processing. I plan to more or 
less follow the curriculum of a course from UiO called IN2110 - Spr√•kteknologiske metoder - which will be discontinued in not too long. 

I hope to end up with a combination of python code for the algorithms, some visualizations and perhaps too a few notebooks with a combination 
of runnable code and explanations.
