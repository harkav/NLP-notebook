# NLP-notebook

In this project, I hope to demonstrate several algorithms used in Natural language processing. I plan to more or 
less follow the curriculum of a course from UiO called IN2110 - Spr√•kteknologiske metoder - which will be discontinued in not too long. 

I hope to end up with a combination of python code for the algorithms, some visualizations and perhaps too a few notebooks with a combination 
of runnable code and explanations. 

Everything is a work in progress, not everything will run as expected. I should probably add something 
to indicate the degree of completion at some point. 

Future plans: 

First part is to finish up with the algorithms dot product, cosine similarity, euclidean distance and TF-IDF. 
I'll try to make python implementations of the algorithms, a doc explaining the algorithms as well as some tests and examples.
